# Abstain-R1
---
We fine-tune the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based on [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) and a composite reward function to optimize the delicate balance between refusal and clarification when facing unanswerable queries, all while ensuring high accuracy on answerable queries.

Models are available on [Abstain-R1](https://huggingface.co/collections/leoleung04/abstain-r1)
